# Sample Tests

These samples are separately-implemented test content before integrating all into one complete functional module.

## Include the libraries

These tests use some Arduino built-in dependencies, including additional ones written by the authors of the project. Make sure to install (copy-paste them) in the Arduino's root-folder where Arduino can locate them and avoid compiling errors.
