    \section{Code Repository}
    \label{sec:code-repo}

    All the code implemented during the execution of the prototype described in this report is available on the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/ralflorent/smart-outlet}{https://github.com/ralflorent/smart-outlet}.

    \section{Understand the Repository}
    It is highly recommended to check and read the markdown files (e.g. \emph{README.md}) to encourage further understanding of every part of the repository. It is a self-sufficient, self-explanatory repository where every taken step is detailed with sustainable reasons.

    We also try to follow the best practices by using the recommendations of the open-source community. For example, observe how we use the commit messages, the file structures, the naming conventions, and so forth.

    Finally, we use up-to-date tools and software so that we can take advantage of their fully-available features. To illustrate our point, we use the last version Angular Framework to develop the web application. That is, supporting and upgrading this framework is indisputably easy.
