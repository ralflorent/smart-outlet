\begin{abstract}
    This document provides a detailed explaination on how the Smart Outlet project is built, used, and tested. This explaination spans from the specifications of the electronic modules to the very constructed prototype. It also includes information on the methodology used as well as the final results, which eventually are a final device being switched on or off remotely by an end-user.

    This document serves also as a guide for describing the different techniques used to implement the high level (software-based) part of this project.
