\section{Results and Discussions}
\label{sec:res-and-disc}

In this report, the different, relevant aspects of the project prototype called
Smart Outlet have been presented and described. The central component of the
project is the Arduino, which acts as micro-task supervisor and controls the
input/output functions of the chips as described in Section
\ref{sec:methodology}. Figure \ref{fig:proto} shows the prototype
assembled in the laboratory environment.

Other important aspects of this work include the architecture and design of
the different components used to make the prototype work. Knowledge of
Computer Networking, Web API, Web APP and Sensor Circuitry were fundamental in
building a complex module with the intended functionality.

To complete the project, trial and error approaches were employed in
gaining a greater control over each of our different components and then we
proceeded to merge the functionalities of the components. This part
also required trial and error as the interconnection of the modules not always
worked out the way they were expected to.

The prototype works as described in Section \ref{sec:methodology}. The user is able, 
either through a smartphone or a PC to manipulate the Smart Outlet by
switching it ON/OFF with the ultimate goal being a better energy consumption.
The user can also view the status of the outlet in real-time and further view a
history of the working of the outlet as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ui-history}.
